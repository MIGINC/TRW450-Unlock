# TRW450-Unlock
This repository provides locations and instructions to enable indirect TPMS and ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) functionality on VAG group TRW450 ABS modules.

This project was created to address the limited availability of TRW450 units that support ACC, allowing enthusiasts and modders to repair and retrofit older VAG vehicles, keeping them functional.

## Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
FOR OFF-ROAD USE ONLY

Modifications to your ABS module are intended for off-road or testing purposes only. Using modified firmware on public roads may violate local regulations and is done entirely at your own risk.
- **No original firmware files are included.** You must obtain these yourself.
- **Use at your own risk!** Modifying ABS firmware can have safety implications. Ensure patches are tested before applying them to your car.
- **Checksum Mismatch Recovery** If the checksum does not match after flashing, the ABS module will typically fall back to bootloader mode, allowing recovery. However, there is still a small risk of bricking the device. Be prepared to replace the module if needed.
